ðŸ’» Technical Details
This application is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

HTML: Provides the semantic structure of the application.

CSS: Uses Tailwind CSS for rapid and consistent styling, giving the app a clean, modern look. Custom styles are added for elements like the active filter button.

JavaScript: Manages the application's state, handles all user interactions (like adding, deleting, and filtering tasks), and dynamically updates the DOM.

ðŸ’¾ Data Persistence
All your tasks are saved directly in your browser's localStorage. This means there is no database or server involved. The data is stored locally on your device, which is why your tasks remain even after you close the app.
